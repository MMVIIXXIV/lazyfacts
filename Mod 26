For this exercise, i also dont know how to solve ROT13 cryptography. lol not really .
so basically, as far as i understand rot13 is 'rotate by 13 places'
it is a very simple cyber which is based on asicii. for eg, the ascii value for 'A' is 65, after encrpyting, its asicii value will be 73 which is 'N' .vice versa, if it is 'N' then its 'A'.
I used online decrypter for this one .

The website i used -https://rot13.com/
