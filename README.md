some labs exercises
Please note that I'm still at very beginner level.My solutions may not be the best.
If you have better ways or even if it is another way, please let me know.
Different users may have different flags,which means YOUR FLAG AND MINE MAY BE DIFFERENT , so instead of copying the whole process, i want you to understand the process.
Thanks
